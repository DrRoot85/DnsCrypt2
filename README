# Usage as a flake

[![FlakeHub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://flakehub.com/f/DrRoot85/Flakes/badge)](https://flakehub.com/flake/DrRoot85/Flakes)

change acording to your use:
         * networking = {
        # if you use NetworkManager 
              nameservers = [ "127.0.0.1" "::1" ];
              networkmanager.enable = true;
              networkmanager.dns = "none";
         # if you use DHCPCD Uncomment This one and disable NetworkManager
         #    dhcpcd.extraConfig = "nohook resolv.conf";

Add Flakes to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.Flakes.url = "https://flakehub.com/f/DrRoot85/Flakes/*.tar.gz";

  outputs = { self, Flakes }: {
    # Use in your outputs
  };
}

```
